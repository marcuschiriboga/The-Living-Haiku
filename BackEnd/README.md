THE LIVING HAIKU

PITCH
The living haiku is a website where users can post short poems that then get added to and changed by others to create hilarious and unexpected results. This mad-libs like game will be easy to use and HILARIOUS. Long term, we will continue to crowdsource great unique ideas vetted by the masses for our library of unique content.
Problem : bad mood :(
Solution : funny poems :)

FRONT END

Basic features 
Login e.t.c.
Post, edit, or  like, poems. 
Simply amazing.
The website will have a quiet and zen feel with users posting to their own spaces as well as the public feed.  
Project objectives
Have lists of the most liked poems, random poems, poem generator, segmented movement.

The users will be able to manage their own stories and post into other users’ stories. There will be a segmentation system that lets us combine the pieces into new and unexpected results generated at random or by user selection. Looking at one section of haiku/poem you’ll be able to go to the next random poem-snippet to look for the hidden gold poems.

The main page will include links to individual poems as well as top rated, most commented, most popular users etc. 

Back End 
Haikus will be split 
Three lines for easy sorting 
Randomizing, next

Server serving each page and endpoint. 

Permanently storing and retrieving poem segments into a file or a few files and being able to access them when needed. 

Permanently saving and retrieving important user data like username, password, or likesfood. 

Generating random poems 

Liking and sorting poem snippets and full poems. 

Reporting and deleting bad poems and users. 

Project expectations. 
45/55 front and back end. User interface is going to be very important in delivering the tone, but I don’t want an overwhelming and busy experience.
The back end will handle the storage and retrieval of the poem segments and other server related tasks. In addition, it will have randomization logic to mix up the poems. 

I was expecting to use react, express, redux, pug, bootstrap and other libraries to help set up my server and interactive webpage.
